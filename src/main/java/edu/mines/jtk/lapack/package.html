Linear algebra via LAPACK.
<p>
This Java package depends on the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/netlib-java/">netlib-java project</a>,
which has translated LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) Fortran subroutines
into Java methods.
This package works as pure Java, but can also use native implementations 
of BLAS and LAPACK if provided.
<p>
For more information on LAPACK, see
Anderson, E., Bai, Z., Bischof, C., Blackford, S., Demmel, J., Dongarra, J., 
Du Croz, J., Greenbaum, A, Hammarling, S, McKenney, A, and Sorensen, D., 
1999, LAPACK Users' Guide, 3rd Edition, SIAM.
<p>
The interface presented by this package is adapted from that of the
public-domain pure Java package Jama, which was developed by 
Joe Hicklin, Cleve Moler, and Peter Webb of The MathWorks, Inc., and by
Ronald Boisvert, Bruce Miller, Roldan Pozo, and Karin Remington of the
National Institue of Standards and Technology.
